# Simple Python Password List Generator

This simple script takes 2 or 3 txt files, containing string lists, as input and generate a txt files with a list of strings including all the inputs combinations.   

Works on Linux, since I used os.system with some Linux-native commands.

Usage:

Just specify 2 or 3 input file as arguments. Example: python py_password_list_generator.py file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
